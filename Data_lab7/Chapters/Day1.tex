\chapter{My Chapter learning}

Dear Diary,
It was a wonderful experience for me to lot important things in the class. I would like
to share some the important things.
\section{Math class}
The equation of Latent Dirichlet allocation is very helpful in natural language processing
for modelling a generative statistical model. The equation of the model is shown below
:-
\begin{equation}
{\textit{p}}\big(\beta,\theta,\textit{z},\textit{w} | \alpha ,\eta \big) = \prod_{i=1}^K{\textit{p}}\big(\beta_\textit{i}| \eta\big)  \prod_{d=1}^D{\textit{p}}\big(\theta_\textit{d}, \alpha\big) \big( \prod_{n=1}^N{\textit{p}}\big(\textit{z}_\textit{d,n}| \theta_\textit{d}\big) {\textit{p}}\big(\textit{w}_\textit{d,n}| \beta_\textit{1:K}, \textit{z}_\textit{d,n} \big)\big)
\end{equation}



Also the formula of cumulative distribution function in case of uniform probability measure is :-
sure is :-
\begin{equation}
\textit{F(x)} = \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{0, if $x<a$}\\
        \frac{x-a}{b-a}, & \text{if $a \leq x \leq b$}\\
        1, & \text {if $x>b$}\\
    \end{cases}    
\end{equation}

\section{Counting sort}
Counting sort is one of the nice algorithm which is not comparison based sorting. Below
is the counting sort algorithm :-

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Counting Sort}\label{alg:euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Counting-Sort}{A, B, k}
\State Let C[0,...,k] be a new array
\State \textbf{for} i=0 to k : \textbf{do}
\State     C[i] = 0
\State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{Initializing step}
\State \textbf{for} j=1 to A.length or n : \textbf{do}
\State    C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] + 1
\State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{Maintaining count}
\State \textbf{for} i=1 to k: \textbf{do}
\State    C[i] = C[i] + C[i − 1]
\State \textbf{for} j=n or A.length down to 1: \textbf{do}
\State    B[C[A[j]]] = A[j]
\State    C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] − 1

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
