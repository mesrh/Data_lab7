Sentiment analysis is very important in extracting the sentiment behind the text, which can be mainly classified as positive, negative and neutral. With the growth of social media, sentiment analysis and opinion mining has become very helpful in identifying the opinion and sentiment and its related concepts such as sentiments, evaluations, attitudes and emotions and have wide application in product review, political survey, opinion polling etc. Positive or negative sentiment while sometimes depends on universally accepted positive or negative words, while sometimes it depends on positive or negative words under different topics. Topic modelling provides very useful tool in aspect based sentiment analysis. In this report we will take the journey from the creation of SENTIWORDNET, a lexical resource to sentiment analysis and opinion mining and go upto application of topic modelling for sentiment analysis, which based on different application helps in sentimental analysis.
